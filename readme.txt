Medical Insurance Cost Estimator

MY goal: Predict the medical insurance charge based on the patient data includes age, smoking, BMI etc.

Data Collection : I have used the dataset from Kaggle insurance.csv for my analysis. The dataset includes attributes like age, bmi, sex, children, smoker, region, charges.

Data Cleaning : clean the dataset, if the column has null or missing values in this we identity and clean the data. 

Data Analysis(EDA) : used python packages pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for analysis and plots to compare how does each feature will affect the medical charges.

preprocess the insurance dataset step by step so it's clean and ready for modeling.

Feature Engineering: create interaction features these will help how the effect of age or bmi on charges will differ between smokers and non smokers.
